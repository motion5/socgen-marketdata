## .Net Challenge
#### Building a Market data contribution Gateway.

### Background
Market data distribution is at the heart of every financial system from pre-trade (pricing) to post-trade
(risks computation). It is important to have a system that can collect, store, and return these for
different scenarios.
We would like to build a Market data contribution gateway, an API based application that will allow
users to store, retrieve and distribute these market data (e.g.: financial quotes such as FxQuote, Swapâ€™s
level, etc.) for different scenario.
Contributing a market data involves multiple steps and entities:

**assumption: using http status code to display, successful and unsuccessful response**

Business users -> Market Data contribution gateway -> Market Data Validation
1. Business users -> Individual who is contributing the market quote.
2. Market data contribution gateway -> Responsible for validating request by requesting the
   market data validation service, storing market data, and returning contribution responses.
3. Market Data validation service: Allows to check the market data contribution rights, format
   (example: Negative FxQuote), legal auditing (Financial regulation framework validation such as
   MIFID, etc.) and reply with an appropriate response code.
   We will be building the Market data contribution gateway and only simulating the Market data
   validation service component in order to allow us to fully test the contribution flow.

### Requirements
   The product requirements for this initial phase are the following:

1. Business users should be able to process a market data contribution through the Market data
   contribution gateway and receive either a successful or unsuccessful response.
 
2. Business users should be able to retrieve the details of a previously contributed market data.
   The next section will discuss each of these in detail.
 
**assumption is there would be a ui, but the assumption here is the business user has a way of sending a rest request**
 
### Process a market data contribution
   The market data contribution gateway will need to provide business users with a way to process a
   contribution. To do this, Business users should be able to submit a request to the gateway. A
   contribution request should include appropriate fields such as market data type and the market data
   itself. Market data could be of any type and structure but to keep it simple the contribution should be
   able to process at least Fx quotes (ex: FxQuote, EUR/USD, bid, ask).

**assumption: the market data type is received as a string**

**assumption: the market data is received as a json object**

**assumption: the assumption of the bid and ask numbers is that it is coming to me in a pounds and pence (fractional decimal format). So we are assuming that the data type will be a decimal, as apposed to representing as an integer or a double**

### Note: Simulating the validation
   In your solution you should simulate or otherwise mock the validation part. This component should be
   able to be switched out for a real validation service once we move to production. We should assume
   that a validation service returns a unique identifier and a status that indicates whether the validation was successful or not

### Deliverables
1. Build and API that allows a business user.

   a. To process a market data contribution through your Market data contribution Gateway
 
   b. To retrieve details of a previously made contributions.
 
### Considerations
   Include whatever documentation/notes you feel is appropriate, this should include some details of  assumptions made, areas you fell could be improved etc. 

### Extra mile bonus points (not a requirement)
   In addition to the above, time permitting, consider the following suggestions for taking your  implementation a step further:

- [ ] Application logging // easy - 
- [ ] Application metrics // easy -
- [ ] Containerization // easy
- [ ] Authentication // bit more difficult, can consider
- [ ] API client // swagger browser
- [ ] Build script / CI
- [ ] Performance testing
- [ ] Encryption
- [ ] Data storage
- [ ] Anything else you feel may benefit your solution from a technical perspective.
